this is a sample Twilio Studio flow for a Hubspot integration. It just executes the Twilio function and passes the information to Flex.

To use it, create a new Studio flow through the Twilio Console and select the Import from JSON option, then paste the content on the json document.

Make sure you edit the "Fetch_CRM_ID" node so that it runs the Twilio Function.
